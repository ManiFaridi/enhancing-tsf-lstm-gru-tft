Abstract—In this work, use deep learning algorithms in combination with technical indicators to achieve a better performance compared to the previous proposed models. Focusing on S&P 500 ETF (SPY). After we preprocessed the data and feature engineered it, we fed it to the neural network architecture, designed to produce prediction for three days in the future. The results indicate the effectiveness of the model architecture in accurate prediction.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Time series forecasting of stock price, is valuable and impactful asset of any trader and broker. Via developing these models, they can make use of this technology to achieve better results and high financial gains. However, volatility of the market makes it hard to use statistical models in the real world, although they were promising in test environment. 

Analysts and brokers have been using technical indicators for a long time. These indicators depict the trends, momentum and volatility of the market. We have chosen a wide range of indicators that cover trends, momentum and volume. Which can give the neural network the full insights it needs to learn about the market. Combining these indicators with RNNs and transformers can yield to a high prediction accuracy. 

We have seen potential in time series prediction from deep learning model, particularly from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) have proved to be the more effective members of the recurrent family, mostly because they do not have the problems such as vanishing or exploding of gradients.  

One cannot overstate the importance of accurate predictions, whether it is on financial data, weather or any timely data. Here in this paper, we explore the integration of technical indicators into the deep learning architectures. The aim in this paper is to develop a model that captures the complex temporal dependencies in financial data, proposing a model architecture that can predict three days into the future with high accuracy.
